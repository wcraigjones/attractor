I’m sorry, but I don’t have enough information about the repository’s current contents and structure—particularly the existing code inside the files that need to be changed—to produce an accurate, directly applicable git diff. If you can share the relevant file contents (for example, the current versions of `apps/factory-api/src/main.ts`, `apps/factory-web/src/server/main.ts`, and `apps/factory-web/src/client/main.tsx`, along with the Helm templates), I’ll be able to craft the exact code changes needed to add the deploy-visible versioning.
