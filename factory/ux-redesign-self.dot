  // Planning intent for codergen:
  // Produce a concrete, implementation-ready redesign plan for this repository's
  // factory-web app with:
  // 1) information architecture and page map,
  // 2) route structure and shared shell/nav behavior,
  // 3) per-page UX requirements and wireframe-level guidance,
  // 4) component and state-management boundaries,
  // 5) migration steps that preserve current functionality while improving usability.
